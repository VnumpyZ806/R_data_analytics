# R_data_analytics

I am going to make a small alteration

Data Analytics Telco project executed at Machine Learning module during the completion of MSc Business Analytics degree. The objectives of the project are as follows:
1) Overview of the typical customer profile within Telco-Customer-Churn.csv dataset
2) Which customers are likey to churn and 
3) What are the potential chances of their retention

Please refer to:
- Telco-Customer-Churn.csv to see the original data
- Telco_Assignment.R file to see the R code script used to interrogate the data in the file, visualise it, and built a predictive model on which customers 
are likely to churn
- Machine_Learning_Report.docx to see the full Word written report on the basis of R analysis

Please see some of the key project visualisations and decision tree analytics below
