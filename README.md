# R_data_analytics

I am going to make a small alteration

Data Analytics Telco project executed at Machine Learning module during the completion of MSc Business Analytics degree. The objectives of the project are as follows:
1) Overview of the typical customer profile within Telco-Customer-Churn.csv dataset
2) Which customers are likey to churn and 
3) What are the potential chances of their retention

Please refer to:
- Telco-Customer-Churn.csv to see the original data
- Telco_Assignment.R file to see the R code script used to interrogate the data in the file, visualise it, and built a predictive model on which customers 
are likely to churn
- Machine_Learning_Report.docx to see the full Word written report on the basis of R analysis

Please see some of the key project visualisations and decision tree analytics below:

The dataset is relatively unbalanced with more than 5140 customers being a non-churn customer against 1860 Churn customers

Customers who use electronic check as a Payment method are much more likely to churn (around 1050).

Both males and females have the same likelihood to churn

The main advantages of decision tree algorithm are its feature categorisation simplicity, plain visualisation sight
